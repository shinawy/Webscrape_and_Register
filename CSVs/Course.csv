ARIC,5130, Poetry for Historians," This course is deigned to give historians the tools and background they need in order to use classical Arabic poetic material for their research.

GHHE,5180, Experimental Design and Research Methods," Qualitative research has a long history in the social sciences. Its roots can be traced to anthropology, philosophy and sociology and its use as a method of inquiry goes back to the early decades of the twentieth century. Qualitative approaches are becoming part of alternative forms of research in medicine as practitioners look at the complex health issues that are often confronted. Qualitative research tends to seek answers to problems about which little is known and its aim is to elicit explanations from the “patient’s point of view”; thus seeking the meaning or the experience of the individual. In other words, qualitative methods enable researchers to access areas of inquiry not typically amenable to quantitative research. In contrast, the use of “objective” measures based on diagnostic criteria, whether physiologically or laboratory-based often rely on numbers, but cannot be completely removed from qualitative aspects of a diagnosis. The aim of this course is to introduce some of the qualitative and quantitative research methods currently used in health care research and to explore how they can be appropriately and fruitfully employed.", N/A, N/A,3,3
GHHE,5190, Diseases and Social Perception," Diseases have meanings and those meanings translate into the way in which sufferers and society perceive and engage with their disease. Discourse on disease is often most charged when the disease in question threatens to cross borders, socioeconomic, national, or otherwise and, in these instances, the media is often complicit with “othering” the disease in a way that may have very real, material consequences. Examples from recent media coverage that have “otherized” the etiology of diseases, whether the disease covered is SARS as an Asian disease, the swine flu as a Mexican disease, Tuberculosis as an immigrant disease, or HIV/AIDs as a Haitian disease. In addition, effective therapy and support is often hampered by how social perception stigmatizes diseases such as mental illness, autism, Down syndrome and the like. This is no less so in the case of the sufferer’s self-image: when a woman undergoes a radical mastectomy, or when one is the victim of a disfiguring accident. The outcome, in terms of disease management and resources, is further influenced by the media’s shaping of society’s perception of the “disease of the day” through language. Through a look at several case studies and current literature, this course will focus on the ways in which disease takes on meaning and, in many cases, emerges as a signifier for something altogether different.", N/A, N/A,3,3

PHIL,3200, Philosophy of History," Philosophies of History offer a broad range of reflections on the historic dimension of our existence, i.e. on the fact that we understand ourselves in a temporal horizon of being-with-others. These reflections might prompt us to reflect on the genesis of notions such as ‘universal history’ or ‘progress’, or they might aim at clarifying what we mean when we ascribe causality to individuals, groups or any other kind of ‘historical force’. Finally, we might even feel the need to analyze and evaluate which ways of conceiving of a maximal horizon of action are rationally justifiable in the situation we find ourselves in.", N/A, N/A,3,3

PHIL,5101, Advanced Seminar in Classical Philosophy," This course will deal with issues in Ancient Greek and Medieval Philosophy that are relevant for an appreciation of Egypt’s philosophical tradition, as well as for an understanding of the philosophical debates that contributed to the development of Islamic Philosophy. Special emphasis will accordingly be placed upon the following: Some of the great philosophers who lived and worked in Egypt (such as Philo Judaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen and Moses Maimonides); the history of Platonism (Plato, Plotinus and the Ancient commentators on Plato and Aristotle working in the schools of Athens and Alexandria); and the Aristotelian tradition (Aristotle, Alexander of Aphrodisias and Themistius).", N/A, N/A,3,3
PHIL,5104, Selected Topics in Contemporary Philosophy," Contemporary philosophy is pluralistic. This trait expresses itself in different conceptions of the task of philosophy and its methods. The motives of this pluralism often reflect differing - scientistic, liberalistic, modernist, posthumanist - attitudes towards the unprecedented dynamics with which historical processes originating in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries are seen to continue to determine our articulation of the human condition. Along these lines this course explores thematic strands which are constitutive of both the unity in the questioning outlook and the plurality of the answers proposed in contemporary philosophy. Such explorations might concern the discourse on language as an unsurmoun   horizon of our capacity to understand (Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Davidson, Derrida); they might delineate different conceptions of the status and role of philosophy vis-à-vis the natural sciences as developed in the analytic, neo-Kantian, pragmatic or phenomenological-hermeneutic tradition; finally such explorations could aim at a comparison of the various incarnations of the contemporary interest in the concepts of praxis and agency, which animates the discourse no less in critical theory and post-structuralism than it does in analytical theories of action and neo-pragmatist accounts of the grounding of sapience and agency in discursive practices.", N/A, N/A,3,3
PHIL,5109, Applied Ethics," This course is an introductory survey of issues in applied ethics.

PHIL,5117, Philosophy of Language," Although the emphasis on the importance of a systematic philosophical reflection of language is a characteristic feature of its development in the 20th century which, thus, has been described as taking a ‘linguistic turn’, the philosophical interest in language is, nonetheless, almost coeval with the ancient origins of the discipline. As a result of this perennial interest, philosophers have studied various dimensions of language and the ways in which it is constitutive of the way we conceive of ourselves, relate to the world, establish and preserve political communities and partake in a shared historical world of meanings and linguistic practices. This course, consequently, aims at a both historically and systematically informed exploration of these dimensions of language in its philosophical reflection.", N/A, Offered in fall.,3,3
PHIL,5120, Advanced Seminar in Feminist Philosophy," This advanced seminar will focus on a particular issue in feminist philosophy. Topics will vary and may include an emphasis on sex, gender, class, race, embodiment, power, intersectionality, disability, and other contemporary issues relevant to feminism.", N/A, N/A,3,3
PHIL,5121, Philosophical Logic," Speaking of logic, we do not only mean that science which analyzes the components, forms and grounds of the soundness of reasoning; we do also refer to a human capacity that comes into play whenever we defend our claims and attack those of others. Logic, thus, is both: a theory that can be studied and a know-how, governing our practices of argumentation. With that in mind, philosophers are expected to cultivate their abilities to analyze and critically assess the logical structures of philosophical arguments.

PHIL,5130, Philosophy of Mind," This course is an introduction to the philosophy of mind. Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that deals with the analysis and resolution of conceptual questions concerning the nature of the mind.

Could a sufficiently complicated artificial neural network or robot be a conscious agent, in the fullest possible sense? Questions such as these clearly straddle a boundary between conceptual analysis and empirical science.
